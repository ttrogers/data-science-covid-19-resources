## COVID-19 Data Science and Behavior Links

This page collects links to online resources for non-medical, non-expert data-scientists interested in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavioral responses to same. I'm new to Git pages and GitHub generally and welcome suggestions, edits, additions, etc.

### Data repositories

_Disease spread/status_

- [Johns Hopkins Github repo for data and dashboard visualization](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

- [Worldometers interactive data visualizations by country](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

- [New York Times disease/death count data by state](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

- This [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing) contains a table with number of tests conducted per country and results.

_Human behavior datasets_

- [Dataset of major containment efforts by country and date](http://epidemicforecasting.org/containment)

- [Attitudes about COVID-19, Pew research center interactive](https://www.pewresearch.org/pathways-2020/)

- [International COVID-19 survey web page, with link to OSF](https://covid19-survey.org/results.html)

- [Large dataset indicating tweet ID and sentiment score for COVID-19 tweets](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/corona-virus-covid-19-tweets-dataset)
  - [A beginners resource to hydrating and using Tweet datasets](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/beginners-guide-to-twitter-data#hydrating)

- [Unacast visualizations showing social distancing metrics including travel distance data.](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard)

- [Google mobility reports showing plots of mobility data by country and subregion.](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)

### Models

- This [Kaggle COVID-19 page](https://www.kaggle.com/tags/covid19) has links to datasets, code for models, and contests.

- Here is code to implement [global forecast using SIR models](https://www.kaggle.com/saga21/covid-global-forecast-sir-model-ml-regressions)

- [R code and libraries for running/assessing SIR models.](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/6852_c59c5a2e8ea3456abbeb017185de603e.html)

### UW-Madison-based resources:

- The [UW Data-science coalition for COVID-19](https://datascience.wisc.edu/covid19/) has links to many resources to several resources including state and national data and visualizations. Here are some I thought particularly useful:
  - [COVIDIFY---Python library for getting latest global data](https://github.com/AaronWard/covidify)
  - [Wisconsin COVID-19 status visualized](https://uw-mad.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/d154b68773b940ffa7871a45ddc0ac95)
  - [Data and visualizations mapping mobility changes at the county level across US](https://geods.geography.wisc.edu/archives/2038)

- [Jerry Zhu's "ten-hundred" plot to visualize exponential growth (Youtube explanation and Matlab code):](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/COVID19/)

- [Laurent Lessard's JuPyTeR notebook for downloading/visualizing Johns Hopkins data](https://github.com/LaurentLessard/covid19/blob/master/covid.ipynb)

- [Scott Sievert's blog visualizing various aspects of disease spread](https://stsievert.com/blog/2020/03/14/covid-19/)

### Visualizations and interactive demos

- [Washington Post: How social distancing flattens the curve.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) This is a compelling visualization of SIR models, and why social distancing is the best intervention we currently have for limiting mass death in US.

- [Interactive simulation modeling at Melting Asphalt](https://www.meltingasphalt.com/interactive/outbreak/). This fantastic interactive tools for SIR modeling gives a sense for how different assumptions about the disease do/do not impact total spread and fatalities, ending with an exercise in which _you_ can try to figure out how best to "flatten the curve."

- [Video overview of SIR models and additional complexities from 3 brown 1 blue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs) This 20-minute video is worth your while if you want to understand some of the complexities that arise under SIR models with more realistic assumptions.

- [Financial times COVID page with several graphical visualizations.](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest)



## Studies of human behavior.

- [Vox article: Partisan affiliation is the best predictor of behavior during pandemic.](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/science-and-health/2020/3/31/21199271/coronavirus-in-us-trump-republicans-democrats-survey-epistemic-crisis?)
  - [Primary-source paper.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3562796)
